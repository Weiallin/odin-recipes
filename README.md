TOP HTML Recipes

This project is to test my knowledge up to this point on HTML.
For this project I will be building a basic recipe website using only
HTML. I will come back to and improve on this website once I learn more
about CSS.

This website will consist of a main index page or a homepage.
The homepage will have links to other pages that will contain the 
recipe, cooking steps, and an image.

I will incorporate what I learn so far and that is setting up a basic
HTML template, adding a title, using different header sizes, using
unordered and ordered list, linking images from the web (absolute path)
as well as a relative path, include a image alternative description, and
making sure I commit as I go.
